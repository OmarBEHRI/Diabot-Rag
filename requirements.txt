# IMPORTANT FOR GPU: Install PyTorch with CUDA support
# Go to: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# Select stable, your OS, pip, Python, and the CUDA version matching your driver
# Example command (CHECK THE PYTORCH SITE FOR YOUR SPECIFIC COMMAND):
# pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# Add the specific torch install command recommended by PyTorch to your setup steps,
# often it's better to run it manually BEFORE pip install -r requirements.txt
