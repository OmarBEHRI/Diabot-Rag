# Diabetes Complications and Prevention

Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening.

## Potential Complications

### Cardiovascular Disease

Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and narrowing of blood vessels (atherosclerosis). About 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.

### Nerve Damage (Neuropathy)

Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Poorly controlled blood sugar can eventually cause you to lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs.

### Kidney Damage (Nephropathy)

The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.

### Eye Damage (Retinopathy)

Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma.

### Foot Damage

Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation.

### Skin Conditions

Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.

### Hearing Impairment

Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.

### Alzheimer's Disease

Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be.

### Depression

Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2
